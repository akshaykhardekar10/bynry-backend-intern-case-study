## Overview

This repository contains my responses to the Backend Engineering Intern case study provided by Bynry Inc.
The objective of this submission is to demonstrate my understanding of backend fundamentals, problem-solving approach, and ability to work with incomplete requirements within a limited time frame.

The solutions focus on **easy to medium level problems**, written from a **fresher/intern perspective**, and prioritize clarity and correctness over advanced optimizations.

## Part 1: Code Review & Debugging

- Reviewed an existing API endpoint for product creation
- Identified common issues such as missing validation, SKU uniqueness, and improper data handling
- Provided a corrected version with simple fixes and explanations

File:

```
part-1-code-review/create_product_review.md
```

---

## Part 2: Database Design

- Designed a basic database schema for an inventory management system
- Covered core entities such as Company, Warehouse, Product, Inventory, and Supplier
- Highlighted missing requirements and assumptions
- Kept the design simple and easy to understand

File:

```
part-2-database-design/schema.md
```

---

## Part 3: Low Stock Alerts API

- Implemented a basic API endpoint to fetch low-stock alerts for a company
- Followed given response structure and business rules at a high level
- Documented assumptions and limitations due to incomplete requirements

File:

```
part-3-api-implementation/low_stock_alerts.py
```

---

## Assumptions & Scope

- The solutions are not production-ready and focus on core logic only
- Advanced topics such as performance optimization, caching, pagination, and complex business rules are intentionally excluded
- Assumptions are clearly documented in each part where requirements were unclear

---

## Final Note

This submission reflects my current skill level as a backend engineering fresher and my approach to learning and problem-solving.
I look forward to discussing these solutions, the trade-offs made, and possible improvements during the interview.

Thank you for the opportunity.
